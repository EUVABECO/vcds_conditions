      Cxxx: "Date of penultimate COVID-19"
      Hxxx: "To be completed if you have had two or three separate documented infections of covid 19: biological evidence is required (RT-PCR or antigenic test) for each episode."

      Hxxx: "To be completed if you have had three separate documented infections of covid 19: biological evidence is required (RT-PCR or antigenic test) for each episode."
    Other infections:
      Cxxx: "Date of last history of pertussis"
      Hxxx: "You must be sure that it is pertussis (proven by a biological test, check with your doctor).

If the disease occurred before the age of two, the vaccination program is continued as usual."
